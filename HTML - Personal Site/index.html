        <h1>Stephanie Miller</h1>
        <p><em>Aspiring Software Developer</em></p>
        <p>A stay-at-home-mom of three for nearly 8 years with a background in <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/what-is-ophthalmologist">ophthalmology</a>, Stephanie made an abrupt life change when she faced divorce in April of 2020, after the world had shut down with the onset of a global pandemic. Almost by accident, Stephanie stumbled into the field of technology with very limited abilities and knowledge. Through perseverance, determination, and lots of late nights, she has set herself up for a brilliant future in software engineering. She is learning Python and web development through online courses through Udemy. Although she is a single mom of three very young children, she works tirelessly to learn in order to provide a good life for her and her children. </p>
